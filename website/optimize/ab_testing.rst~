How to do A/B Testing
=====================

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        A/B testing is the process of testing two versions of a page to see which one performs better in reaching your business objectives.

                                <p><strong>1. Define what to test</strong><br/>
                                The main goal is increasing your ROI. Figure out the best page(s) to
                                test. Here are a few examples of good testing variables:
                                </p>
                                <li>Call-to-action’s (i.e. button’s) wording, size, color and placement,</li>
                                <li>Headline or product description,</li>
                                <li>Form’s length and types of fields,</li>
                                <li>Product pricing and promotional offers,</li>
                                <li>Images on landing and product pages,</li>
                                <li>Amount of text on the page (short vs. long).</li>
