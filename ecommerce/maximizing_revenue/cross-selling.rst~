How to  cross-selling
============================

In order to maximize your sales revenue, publishing alternative products is strongly advised. That way if one product is not available or basic, you can prompt your customers to look at alternatives, potentially more expensive, by scrolling down the product page.

To do so:

* Select such *Suggested Products* in the *Sales* tab of the product detail form. 3 alternatives are fine! Don't publish too many otherwise your customers will be confused.
