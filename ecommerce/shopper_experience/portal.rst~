How your customers can access their portal
============================

It has never been so easy for your customers to access their documents through a portal. Forget endless signup forms, Odoo makes it as easy as ABC. With eCommerce and Online Quotation apps, your customers are requested to create a portal account (name, email, password only) from the very first order confirmation or online quotation email they get from you.

Sign up

This is what they see when clicking the link in the email.

Once logged in the customer will access his account by clicking *My Account* in the login dropdown menu.

From the portal menu all the customer history can be reviewed. The main address (billing) can also be modified.

.. note:: If a portal user is a contact of a company in your customers data (*Company* field set in customer detail form), this last will see all the documents of the company as well through the portal.
