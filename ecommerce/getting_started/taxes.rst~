How to manage taxes
============================

Tax setup
=========
The default taxes applied in your country are installed automatically for most localizations.

1. `Set default taxes for your products and create them if not existing`: :doc:`../../accounting/others/taxes/create` (see Setting your default taxes).
2. Apply specific taxes per customer localization: :doc:`../../accounting/others/taxes/application`

In the US
---------
If you are based in the US, taxes can be computed automatically thanks to TaxCloud. This is effort-less.

* Create an account on TaxCloud.com.
* Install *Account TaxCloud* addon in :menuselection:`Apps`.
* Enter your credentials in :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`.
* Hit *Sync TaxCloud Catgories (TIC)*.
* Select a default TIC to compute taxes in :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`.
* If some products go under a different TIC, select it from the product detail form (in *Invoicing* tab).

You're good to go!

Tax included in price
=====================

If you want your sales price to be tax-included (B2C), check *Included in Price* in the tax setup form (:menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`).
You can rely on following documentation if you need both tax-included (B2C) and tax-excluded prices (B2B): :doc:`../../sales/products_prices/prices/B2B_B2C`.
