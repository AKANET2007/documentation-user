How to configure product variants
---------------------------------

Product variants are used to offer variations of the same product to your customers on the products page. For example, the customer chooses a T-shirt and then selects its size and color.

To use them:
1. Activate the 'Products can have several attributes, defining variants (Example: size, color,...)' option in Sales / Settings.
2. Select a product from the Products list, go to the 'Variants' tab.
3. Add as many attributes as you need from 3 different types: radio buttons, drop-down menu or color buttons. Each combination of attribute values is a product variant. That way you get variants as soon as there are at least 2 values for 1 attribute.

4. Access the configuration of every single variant from the template form.

You can edit following data:
- Picture (will update in real time on the website)
- Barcode
- Internal Reference
- Volume
- Weight
If you don’t want a specific variant to be available on the website, simply uncheck ‘Active’.

5. You can also set a specific public price per variant by clicking "Variant Prices" in the product detail form (action in top-left corner).

The Price Extra is added to the product price whenever the corresponding attribute value is selected.
