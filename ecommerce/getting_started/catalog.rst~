Most options are available in the *Customize* menu: display attributes, website categories, etc.

If you manage a B2B company, some options are tailored for you: list displaying, product description, Add to Cart (to populate a cart more quickly).

Highlight a product
===================
Boost the visibility of your star/promoted products: push them to top, make them bigger, add a ribbon that you can edit (Sale, New, etc.). Open the Shop page, switch to Edit mode and click any item to start customizing the grid.
