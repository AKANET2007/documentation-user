How to customize your catalog page 
============================

Customize your catalog
===============
All your sellable items can be browsed on the *Shop* page of your website.

Most options are available in the *Customize* menu: display attributes, website categories, etc.

If your customers use to buy several items at once, some options allow them to fill their cart straight from the catalog page: Add to Cart button, list displaying with product description. That way they don't need to open the description page of every single product to add them to cart.

Highlight a product
===================
Boost the visibility of your star/promoted products: push them to top, make them bigger, add a ribbon that you can edit (Sale, New, etc.). Open the Shop page, switch to Edit mode and click any item to start customizing the grid.
