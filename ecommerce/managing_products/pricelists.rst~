How to manage pricing
---------------------------------

This section sheds some light on pricing features specific to e-Commerce. The *Pricelist* documentation is a pre-requisite (see :doc:`../../sales/products_prices/prices/pricing`).

Currency selector
=================

With Odoo you can let your customers choose their own currency.

Create one *Website Pricelist* per currency in :menuselection:`Sales --> Settings --> Website Pricelists`. Select the related pricelist and check *Selectable*.

Geo-IP to automatically apply the right currency
================================================
Use of Country groups. Does it work?


Specific pricelist for web customers (advanced)
============================================
If your online customers are a specific segment, you may want to give them a specific pricelist. To do so:

* Find both *Public user* and *Template User* in :menuselection:`Contacts`. These are technical contacts so there are archived to not show up in your contacts list. To see them, press *Archived* in the search bar.

   :align: center

.. note:: *Public user* is used for any visitor browsing your website without being logged in. *Template User* is used as contact template whenever a new customer portal account is created. 

* Change the pricelist of those two contacts. Notice that each visitor category (anonymous vs registered) can get different pricelists. This can be an incentive for your customers to sign up!
